ppasm

Assembler for the practicum processor.
Run with python 3, enter input and output filenames on prompt.
Most problems with the syntax will be found and the line
where the problem occured will be printed.
Initial implementation of macros is done:

.macro swap(a, b)
XOR a, b, a
XOR b, a, b
XOR a, b, a
.end

swap(R3, R5)

swap(R15, R0)
